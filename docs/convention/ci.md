# Continuous Integration

How a project's checks are named, run, and secured. The rules hold on any toolchain; one toolchain appears at the end as a reference implementation.

## Core principle

Local checks and CI checks are the same checks, invoked by the same names. CI re-runs what a contributor already ran; it does not define a second way to run it.

## One entry point per task

- **One name per task.** Each of lint, format, test, and build has exactly one name that a human and CI both invoke. What implements that name — a task runner, a script, a package manifest entry — is the project's choice; the name is the contract.
- **One name for the whole set.** A single name runs lint, format, test, and build in order, so "run the checks" is one command locally and one step in CI.
- **CI calls the names, not the commands behind them.** A pipeline that spells out the underlying tool invocations has created a second set of commands, and the two drift.
- **An entry point reports what it did.** A suite that skipped every test, a generator that found no input, a check that read only tracked files — each exits zero and reads exactly like the run that did the work. The output has to tell those apart: a count of what was covered, or a failure when the count is zero.
- **Entry points stay thin.** An entry point that has grown past a few lines is one name doing several jobs; re-split it into named tasks rather than letting it become a script. What it may not become is a pipeline component: it runs on a contributor's machine as well as in CI.

## Run the checks before pushing

- Run the project's checks locally before code leaves the machine. CI is the second line of defence, not the only one.
- Automating that locally — a version-control hook, a watch task, an on-save editor command — is the contributor's choice. No tool is mandated, and running the checks by hand satisfies the rule.

## Reuse

A pipeline step is one of two kinds. A check — lint, format, test, build — is invoked by its entry-point name (§One entry point per task). Everything else a pipeline needs — toolchain setup, caching, artifacts, deploys — is a step this section governs.

For each of those steps:

1. **Search for a maintained component** — a published action, plugin, or reusable job — at its current version, before writing pipeline code.
2. **Verify it** per the next section before pinning.
3. **Use it as its own documentation shows**. If no maintained component covers the step, a checked-in script is the fallback — not a license to hand-roll per-job.

## Verify a pinned dependency before adopting it

Before pinning anything the pipeline pulls in — a published component, container image, or tool version — read its own documentation and determine:

1. **Current stable version** — not the remembered one. The version an agent recalls may be deprecated, archived, or replaced.
2. **Exact inputs that version accepts** — inputs shift between releases. Check them against the version's own documentation.
3. **Exact usage pattern** — follow what the documentation shows. Do not paraphrase inputs or rearrange the documented pattern.

Pre-trained recollection is a starting point, not source of truth. An agent that picks a version from memory silently uses a stale or nonexistent release.

Pin to a reference that cannot come to mean something else. A digest or a full commit SHA always satisfies that. So does a version where the ecosystem verifies content against a checksum log the repository also records — a Go module version under `go.sum` and the checksum database, where republishing a tag over different content fails verification instead of substituting silently; bypass that database and the property goes with it. A tag resolved through a mutable pointer, and any branch, satisfies it nowhere.

A pin fixes what a reference means, not what it points at: a digest never receives the patch its tag would have carried. So a pinned dependency also names how it gets moved — a bot that proposes the bump, a scheduled review, an owner — because pinning without that trades a moving dependency for a frozen one.

For every third-party dependency, also check the ecosystem's advisory source for known vulnerabilities in the candidate version.

## Security baseline

- **Minimal permissions**: the pipeline's default credential grants read only; grant write on the single job that needs it.
- **No plain-text secrets**: keep tokens, keys, and credentials in the platform's secret store. Prefer short-lived federated credentials (OIDC) over long-lived keys for cloud access.
- **Avoid script injection**: pass attacker-controlled input to a command through the environment, never interpolated into the command text.
- **Mask derived values**: values derived from secrets that can reach the logs are masked with the platform's masking mechanism.

## Reference implementation

The rules above bind. This section does not: it is one toolchain — Make for the entry points, GitHub Actions for the pipeline — that satisfies them. A project on another toolchain replaces this section and keeps every rule.

### Entry points as a Makefile

```makefile
.PHONY: lint format test build ci

lint:
	<lint-cmd>

format:
	<format-cmd>

test:
	<test-cmd>

build:
	<build-cmd>

ci: lint format test build
```

Replace `<lint-cmd>` and the rest with the project's actual commands (`npm run lint`, `ruff check`, `go test ./...`). Local `make lint` and CI `make lint` then invoke the same command.

### GitHub Actions specifics

- **Existing components**: search the GitHub Marketplace before writing inline `run:` blocks.
- **Advisories**: for every third-party action, check the GitHub Advisory Database (`github.com/advisories?query=type%3Areviewed+ecosystem%3Aactions`) for the candidate version.
- **Toolchain setup**: use the official setup action for the project's language; take its version and inputs from its own docs.
- **Checks**: run `make lint`, `make format`, `make test`, `make build` — the targets, not the commands inside them.
- **Artifacts**: use the artifact action.
- **Permissions**: `permissions: read-all` at the workflow top; `write` granted per job.
- **Secrets**: repo or environment secrets, OIDC for cloud deploys, `::add-mask::VALUE` for values derived from secrets.
- **Pinning**: a full commit SHA.
